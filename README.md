A collection of cybersecurity  resources

## NIST Framework 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework is a voluntary, flexible, and  cybersecurity risk management framework that is based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices. It was created by NIST in collaboration with industry stakeholders and government agencies to provide organizations with a common language for understanding, managing, and reducing cybersecurity risk.

The framework consists of five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover (IDPRR). These functions are further broken down into 23 subcategories and 100+ controls. Organizations can use the framework to tailor their cybersecurity program to fit their specific needs and risks.

This [document](https://github.com/reecekol/cybersecurity/blob/master/NIST/Project1.pdf)  applies two components of the NIST framework to analyze a cybersecurity incident.
